#### WEBPACK
Webpack is indeed a static module bundler primarily used for JavaScript applications, although it can handle various types of assets such as JavaScript, CSS, and images. Its main purpose is to take multiple modules with dependencies and bundle them into a single file or multiple files, often referred to as bundles, that can be served to the browser.
